                    <p>For most people, December 23rd is just another day that falls right before the holidays. To this
                        group of guys, it signifies everyone returning home to help celebrate one of the greatest
                        traditions and holidays of our lives. As we get older, time decides to move faster and faster;
                        we find ourselves further from the street we all grew up on. We knew change was going to happen
                        one day and even though we have absolutely no idea of what life has in store for us from one
                        year to another, we have grown accustomed to the one constant that remains steadfast…Eve Eve.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Most people would laugh if they were told that this tradition originated in a family driveway in
                        a crappy Red Dodge Neon (yes, the car), in a town that practically created a national holiday
                        when it was announced that a Burger King would be built. Yes, that’s exactly how it started.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This tradition was originally an escape for the Ward brothers, Devin and Colby. When your
                        parents aren’t appreciative of holiday cocktails or ruckus being made inside the house, you get
                        creative and find new ways to celebrate the wintery holiday. Our method: head outside into the
                        optimistic snowy weather with a stack of Christmas CD’s, and sing your heart out.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Eve of Christmas Eve tradition quickly grew. More and more friends decided they would also
                        like to enjoy a few holiday cocktails while belting out “Five Golden Rings” without any reproach
                        from any adult. Two became three, three became five, and before we knew it, a second vehicle
                        needed to be added to the driveway lineup.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It wasn’t until a few years ago, we found The Strong Cabin, a “Christmas Miracle” nestled in the
                        woods with just enough rustic charm to make you feel like your sleigh has just made it over the
                        river and through the woods to grandmother’s house. This would become our holiday home.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Besides the tradition of just having our holiday party on December 23rd, every year, for almost
                        twenty years, we have consistently built new yearly traditions into our reunion, including
                        scavenger hunts, beer pong tournaments, and our fan-favorite, professional family Christmas
                        photos. For nearly a decade, we have gathered together to have one lucky photographer take
                        holiday family photos of us. As you will see, we have a blast doing this. But it’s not always
                        about us, we also like to bring happiness to those around us. By choosing locations that are in
                        public, we help bring laughter and smiles to anyone around us.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, we find ourselves in a wide array of professions. From chiropractor and bartender, to
                        police officer and medical professionals, we truly are a diverse group. Some of us are married,
                        while others are dads. Some of us divorced while others are still searching. Life is forever
                        changing and it’s important to us to always remember that. Relationships change, evolve, and
                        end. We bicker and fight, hug and make up. We don’t always see eye-to-eye but we all know we are
                        there for one another. December builds anticipation for one of the greatest holidays all year,
                        we get to recreate that special “night before Christmas” feeling we remember from our
                        childhoods. We are truly blessed to be able to relive that feeling every year while being
                        reminded that family is truly the best present during the holidays.

                            But what makes Nate special is the love he pours into this family. From organizing Eveve

                            is what Nate is all about. BUT, no one enjoys celebrating the holiday harder than Nate. His
